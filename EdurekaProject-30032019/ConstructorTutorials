
	What is a constructor?
	
	- Method with same name as that of class
	- It does not return anything not even null (No return type is declared with a method)
	- It is used to define/assign default values to the variables of a class
	- It is called when an object is created
	- If a class does not have any constructor defined then JVM creates a default constructor for that class
